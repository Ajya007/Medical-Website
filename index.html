              <p>Insurance companies are facing problems in medical/health claims settlement, may it be due to moral hazards or agents working in between insurance companies and insured.

Many medical claims are being settled without proper investigations and medical consultation and with limited medical expertise. Above all, we understand the importance of providing quality medical consultation service and Insured satisfaction. We are joining this industry, with a Vision to help insurance companies tackle these burning issues. </p>
