              <p>Insurance companies are facing problems in medical/health claims settlement, may it be due to moral hazards or agents working in between insurance companies and insured. Evidence of fake medical treatment being brought in the desk of Insurers, submission of medical bills irrelevant to treatment, and overcharged bills are day to day problems faced by Insurance companies. Many medical claims are being settled without proper investigations and medical consultation and with limited medical expertise. Above all, we understand the importance of providing quality medical consultation service and Insured satisfaction. We are joining this industry, with a Vision to help insurance companies tackle these burning issues. </p>
